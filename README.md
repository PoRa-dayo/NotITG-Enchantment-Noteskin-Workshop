A NotITG port of [HURG's Noteskin-Workshop-Enchantment-V2 project for ITGMania](https://github.com/HURG-IIDX/Noteskin-Workshop-Enchantment-V2/tree/main), now fully 3D modeled.

Check the 2D version [here](https://github.com/PoRa-dayo/NotITG-Enchantment-2D-Noteskin-Workshop).

Welcome to the NotITG noteskin workshop for Enchantment! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the "enchantment" noteskin included with ITGmania. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. As this is meant to be fully compatible with NotITG, all arrows and mines now have 3D models! All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "Previews" folder.

*(Scroll down to the Overview section for an overview of the features in this workshop, as well as some previews)*

# Installation
- Install the noteskin by copying the 2 folders inside the "Enchantment - NotITG Port" folder, and inside your NotITG game folder, paste them in NoteSkins/dance. These contain the base default variants of the Enchantment noteskin.

- There are also Test Suites in the "Enchantment - TEST SUITES" folder. Test Suites are variants of the noteskin, that have arrows, holds, rolls, receptors, etc. fully customized beforehand. You can install the Test Suite you want in Noteskins/dance to quickly have a bunch of fully customized variants that you can try out without having to spend time browsing and tinkering. You can check the preview of each Test Suite inside the "Previews" folder.

- In NotITG, when you select a chart, right before the chart is played, when "PRESS [START] TO CHOOSE MODS" show up, do that to get the option to select your noteskin.

*You can change your default settings for NotITG by going to the NotITG game folder, and open and edit Data/GamePrefs.ini.*

# Customization
*You will only be changing the "enchantment-custom" folder.*

- You can check the Previews folder for previews in an easily viewable and browsable format. Use it to figure out what noteskin variant you want.
- Head on to the Customization folder and build your own customized noteskin.
- Keep opening the noteskin variant folders that you prefer until you eventually see the "enchantment-custom" folder.
- Copy the "enchantment-custom" folder.
- In the NotITG game folder, go to NoteSkins/dance folder, then paste the folder and replace files, then restart the game to apply the variant.

- If you like what you have built in the "enchantment-custom" folder, feel free to duplicate the folder and rename it to whatever you want. That way you can save your custom build, and use the "enchantment-custom" folder to customize a new one!


# Overview
This is a port of the Enchantment V2 workshop by HURG. Compared to the original Enchantment, Enchantment V2 features a simpler ornate pattern that looks nicer with smaller arrow sizes, which is more fitting for modcharts, and a lot more customization options. The original Enchantment, made by [EvocaitArt](https://x.com/EvocaitArt), is also ported and is available in this workshop as "Classic" variants.

## Arrows
There are a lot of arrow customization options. (over 400!)

Firstly, the arrow variants are split into two main groups: "Ornate", which includes the floral pattern similar to the original "enchantment" noteskin; and "Plain", which doesn't have the floral pattern.

Secondly, there are color sets for ITG, Dev, DDR note, DDR Vivid, DDR Rainbow, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins. There are also TD (Triplet Denomination) versions of some noteskins, such as TD ITG, that have different colors for 24ths and 48ths.

And lastly, each color set can have some of the following arrow shapes:
- Normal
- Dark (Ornate) / Simple (Plain)
- Gold
- Silver
- Cel Vibrant
- Cel
- Shadow
- Contrast
- Contrast Vibrant
- Void

Below is the "Ornate" arrow shape variations of the ITG color scheme, in the order listed above:

And here is the "Plain" variations with the floral patterns removed for a more simple look:

## Explosions
Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the Ornate "ITG" Glow set, but there are options for color sets like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a DDR tap explosion), Glow (similar to the default ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). There are Ornate and Plain versions of every set. You can also disable tap explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option. Here is a preview of some of the tap explosion options:

![476327256-1ffe8b3f-b3ac-473f-b9d6-798d2aa744e0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91d6a7c5-4785-43d9-ad0f-8e9a97a57dac)


Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal. There are Plain and Ornate versions of every option. By default the skin uses the Ornate "RGB" glow color option. You can also disable hold explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option. Here is a preview image of some of the hold explosion options:

![476327350-dba6822a-5000-40ac-94d4-c6cf0991caf8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f56cba6-8fac-4918-ba00-d60b411d5e78)


## Holds and Rolls
Holds and rolls (active and inactive) can be color customized. Every color option has four types for holds and rolls, and any of the 4 types can be set as active or inactive. Feel free to mix and match different options! Here is a preview image of some of the hold and roll options:

![476327484-f6b55627-aa66-4a3a-9a53-465eff769028](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7819c869-4a98-4ed8-b7bf-97dda64b781a)


## Mines
Mines can be color customized, and for every color option there are three types, each with 2-4 variations. Using the "default" color as an example:

There are normal, full size types:

![476327523-90a1ee95-f2dc-4e8c-9b26-747bf2675031](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b68b08-4ceb-4fc1-a68f-a174736381c9)


There are mini types:

![476327541-b8d36742-41a4-497f-8a76-313afe267ccd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afe9283-9a0c-44b7-b2e4-63ac968ddcde)


And there are also dot types, you know, the one from Etterna, because yes:

![476327553-25226b04-118a-411b-99d6-772160d4cccb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b59c72-4114-48ed-8c78-2af2d6cc453f)


## Receptors
Receptors can be color customized. There are three arttributes for each color, giving a total of eight types:
- Classic Static Plain
- Frame Static Plain
- Classic Static Ornate
- Frame Static Ornate
- Classic Animated Plain
- Frame Animated Plain
- Classic Animated Ornate
- Frame Animated Ornate

Using the "Vapor" color as an example:
![476327678-72fab9cf-299d-4c60-a976-b9fb6009a7a6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92298219-b679-4968-8700-b54bdb7a5dd6)



The receptor pulse that goes along with the song BPM can also be toggled on and off as well.

![Off](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1259897-91c7-4cae-bc24-2253748776e3)



## Arrow Border
NotITG is a game focused on visuals, so a lot of times there will be loads of things happening in the background, killing the readability of lots of noteskins. As the Enchantment noteskin definitely isn't known for having contrasting borders, there is now an option to add an additional border around your arrows, allowing for good readability across NotITG modcharts. It apparently isn't possible to do this sort of thing on 2D noteskins though, so this feature can only be applied to the 3D noteskin.

None, Black, White, Gray, and Light Gray arrow borders, respectively:

## Inaccuracies
I have tried to port most arrows and mines into 3D with the highest accuracy possible by recreating the animations based on what HURG told me. But of course, there are still some minor inaccuracies here and there compared to the 2D version:
- Most of the gradient sheets are recreated by myself, only a few of them are actually obtained from HURG because it'd take a really long time for HURG to export all those gradients, so the colors might be a bit inaccurate.
- Because some shines in the original animations used Overlay blend mode in Photoshop, which cannot be recreated with simple color overlay, all the shine effects present in some variants are inaccurate. Regardless, I've tried my best to find the right colors to make the shine visuals as closest to the original as possible.
- Hold and roll tails are shortened in this port as the game doesn't really like full 64x64 tails.
- Lifts and FA-mode-related things are removed, since you know, they don't exist in NotITG.
